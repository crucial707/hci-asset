# Next steps

- [x] **List recent scans on Scans page** – API `GET /scans` returns recent job IDs; Scans page shows a “Recent scans” table with links to each scan detail.
- [x] **Show heartbeat error on asset detail** – When `?heartbeat_error=1` is present, the asset detail page shows “Failed to record heartbeat. Try again.”
- [x] **Pagination for assets** – Assets list uses `limit=20` and `offset`; Previous/Next links preserve search; page in query.
- [x] **Docker Compose** – API uses config for DB DSN (works with `DB_HOST=postgres`); `web` service added (Dockerfile.web), depends on API, `HCI_ASSET_API_URL=http://api:8080`; `docker compose up` runs postgres, api, web.
- [ ] **Tests** – Unit tests for handlers/repos (e.g. asset/user CRUD, scan job lifecycle) and/or a small API integration test.
- [ ] **CI** – GitHub Actions (or similar) workflow that runs `go build ./...` and tests on push/PR.
